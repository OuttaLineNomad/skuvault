# SkuVault-GO
## Go package for all SkuVault API references 

The Go package was created from the API references from SkuVaults development site [here]:"https://dev.skuvault.com/v1.0/reference".

The package functions are named the same as the reference you want. SkuVaults API is already straightforward, but this just makes it easier.
